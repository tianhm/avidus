misc:
-----
- specify a file name for showme/ts 
- reorganize menus - seperate showme/ts/paintbars from indicators
- chart labelling (e.g. ticker, MACD, legend...)
- grid on/off by individual chart 
- should be able to remove indicators, and indicator charts
- break up edit properties into:
	- edit chart properties
	- edit indicators - only edits the indicators on that chart...
- Color style combos should bring up color editor, not stylecombo
- Integrate with an HTML viewer - for displaying results.
        - Use khtmlw when kde 2.0 bindings are created

Scale:
------
- Scale should be set to high/low value plus/minus a certain number of pixels
- Log Scale on X and Y Axis - look at qt link to charting code, if I can
- Scale on Volume seems to be too high


portfolio:
----------
- should be able to open a group of stocks, and then cycle through them
with forward and back arrows.
- Cycle between groups of stocks
- store trade information - view portfolio performance - can use the
same performance information as the performance analyzer/viewer -
eg. capital appreciation, number of winning trades, etc.


saving of state:
----------------
should be able to save:
 - colors, styles of charts
 - number and type of indicator charts
 - indicators and their properties
 - default view (yearly, three month, etc.)

default chart saved in $HOME/.tact dir and opened on startup 
additional chart styles can be saved by the user, and opened by them


server updating:
----------------
- store start and stop date for each symbol
- update should check the start and stop date and retrieve only missing
symbols


BUGS:
-----
- resize not done correctly (not using visibleWidth() from ScrollView
- resize using wm drag causes display to mess up
